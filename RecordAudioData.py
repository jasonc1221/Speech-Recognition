'''
RecordAudioData names, records and creates a 3 second audio clip 
for data collection for the CPP AI project.(exports as wav to root)
Built on top of and using existing example from PyAudio
Found here: https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio
Used with California Polytechnic University California, Pomona Artificial Intelegence Club
Author: Data Collection Lead, Chris Leal
Date: 30 November, 2017
	
Note: While recording a word try your best to center it within the three second 
	window. Additionally this script requires pyAudio dependency to be installed
