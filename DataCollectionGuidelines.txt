So far all of the data for training our Stt model has been recorded by our members. If you wish to record data please take note of the following:
  - Use the script RecordAudioData.py
    - This script requires python3 and the pyAudio dependency to be installed
  - Data is recorded in three second clips. While recording a word try your best to center it within the three second window.
  - Speak clearly and loudly
  - Keep background noise to a minimum
  - Also follow any instructions the script mentions durring runtime
  - This script will save all wav files it creates to your User folder by default.
